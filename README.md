# 3260 project
- Objects
	- wonder star
		* self-rotating
	- earth
		* self-rotating	
	- energy rings(>3)
		* self-rotating
	- spacecraft
	- asteroid ring cloud
		* >=200 flaoting rocks around wonder star
		* rotate about wonder star
- !skybox
- light source
	- basic lights (ambient....)
	- 

## 5/12
- Camera
	- can move camera and spacecraft by arrow keys 
	- can rotate camera horizontally using mouse x-axis
	- CANNOT rotate the spacecraft together with the camera
- Objects
	- load spacecraft
	- load earth 
		- earth self rotate about y-axis
	- commented code loading others since every launching for test cost time
- lighting
	- temporarily disabled lighting since they caused the texture of earth mutated if scale the earth larger
## 6/12
- Objects
	- load asteroid
	- load all other objects
- lighting
	- set specular light to 0, is it ok?
	- diffuse light is 1.0
	- ambient is normal
- events
	- spacecraft crossing rings texture change
## 7/12
- enhanced lighting
- Bonus
	- normal mapping of earth
	- another light source (red light)
